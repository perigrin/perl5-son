        #      inputs() and consumers() from every cached node (bidirectional
        #      reachability) so a node connected to the graph only via a
        #      consumer pointer (e.g. a void statement-effect with no data
        #      consumer above it) is still found. Consumers are followed only
        #      when they are themselves in %cache -- this is the filter that
        #      keeps the walk graph-local: consumer pointers can reach
        #      foreign nodes (the Bootstrap singleton's hash-cons cache is
        #      process-wide) or orphan nodes (built by losing Earley
        #      alternatives and never merged into any graph), and those must
        #      not appear in the result.
        #
        #   2. ORDER: a topological sort of the membership set using ONLY
        #      producer edges (inputs, plus a Phi's region). A "consumer" is
        #      never a node's producer -- treating consumers as descend-first
        #      DFS children (as pass 1 must, for reachability) makes a
        #      post-order DFS finalize the consumer BEFORE the producer it
        #      reads, a real forward reference. This bit the loop-Phi case
        #      first (a Phi's init input can itself be a root visited before
        #      the Phi, pulling the Phi in early as a consumer-child) but is
        #      not specific to Phi -- any node with more than one path into
        #      the graph can race the same way. Ordering by producer edges
        #      only avoids that class of bug entirely; it is exactly the
        #      pre-unification SoN::IR::Graph::nodes() shape (which never
        #      walked consumers in its topo-sort), generalized to the
        #      unified Node hierarchy's region field.
        #
        # A LOOP header Phi's inputs[1] (the backedge value) is the one
        # exception: it necessarily closes a cycle back to the Phi through
        # the loop body, and the Chalk loader defer-patches exactly that
        # edge via set_backedge once every node has been loaded. Cutting
