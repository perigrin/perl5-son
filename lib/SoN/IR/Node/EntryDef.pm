    # THE SIGIL IS PART OF THE IDENTITY, and it is REQUIRED -- there is no

    # `_` alone names THREE different things in perl: the scalar `$_`, the
    # argument array `@_`, and the bareword `_` filetest handle (`-f _`, which
    # reuses the last stat buffer). A name-only identity hash-consed the first
    # two into ONE node -- measured, a single EntryDef(_) fed both a
    # `shift @_` Call and a RegexMatch subject. The same applies to any stash
    # holding one name under two sigils: `$g` and `@g` are unrelated variables.
    #
    # No default, deliberately: a default lets a construction site omit the
    # sigil and still hash-cons, which is exactly how the collision hid. A
    # sigil-less variable lookup should be impossible to express.
